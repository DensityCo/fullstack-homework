# Density Fullstack Homework Assignment

## Goal
Your goal is to build a web application that displays the latest "heartbeat" from a number of sensors.

## Assignment
Your task is to accomplish the following:
- Use Flask (or some similar Python web framework) to build a web application
- Scaffold a database that includes sensors and heartbeats
- Expose an endpoint that can receive "heartbeats" indicating that the sensor is alive and checking in
- Deliver a webpage where a user can view live, updating heartbeats from the sensors

Bonus Points: Build or tell us how you would include a way to alert users if a sensor hasnâ€™t sent a heartbeat in the last 10 minutes.

## Don't Let the Dog Eat Your Homework
Our goal is to understand your thought process, documentation style, and to get a sense of how you reason about a complex system. Please don't spend more than 3-4 hours on this. We'd prefer incomplete work with notes on what you focused on, where you left off, and the limitations of your solution.

If you get stuck or need more information, don't hesitate to reach out for clarity!
